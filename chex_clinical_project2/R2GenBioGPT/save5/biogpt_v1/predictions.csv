1681,both lungs are clear and expanded. heart and mediastinum normal. no active disease.,. No abnormalities are seen on the chest x-ray film. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema  pleural effusion  pneumothorax  or pneumomediastinum. Both lungs are normal. The only abnormality is a small amount of air in the left hemithorax that may be due to an air embolus from the superior vena cava into the right lung. A follow-up study has shown that this finding is transient and resolves within a few days. These findings are consistent with our current understanding of the pathophysiology of these conditions. We conclude that they are not related to other causes such as
1230,left lung clear. slight cardiomegaly. right effusion. right lower lobe infiltrate. two air-fluid levels in the right hemithorax most representing hydropneumothorax. this radiographic finding could also represent empyema with a bronchopleural fistula. ct scan with iv contrast may be helpful.,). This finding may also be seen in the absence of a pleural effusion  but it is not specific for empyema and should not be used to rule out this diagnosis. • The chest x-ray image can be interpreted as normal if there is no evidence of an empyema or hydropneumothorax.What is the clinical significance of these findings? Pulmonary infiltrates are often subtle and do not require further diagnostic imaging studies (e.g.  thoracentesis or CT scan); however  if they do  they need to be followed by additional imaging such as ultrasound or MRI / CT scans to exclude empyemia.

No pneumomediastinum. There are no abnormalities on the chest x-ray. The patient is in good general health. She has been discharged from the emergency department and is doing well. Follow-up at 6 months shows no evidence of acute or chronic injury. We present this case to highlight the importance of a thorough history  physical examination  laboratory studies  and diagnostic imaging in the evaluation of patients who present with pleuritic chest pain after blunt chest trauma.
3094,heart size is normal. lungs are clear. low lung volumes. there is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion. no acute cardiopulmonary findings.,. There is no pleural effusion. No mediastinal adenopathy. The chest x-ray image is normal. A follow-up of the patient has not shown any changes in lung size or function. What is the clinical significance of this finding and how it should be interpreted remains to be determined. This case report serves as a call for more attention to this rare but potentially life-threatening complication of cocaine abuse  which can be managed conservatively with close observation and serial chest x- ray imaging. It is important to remember that patients who use cocaine are at high risk for pulmonary embolus if they present with acute

2021,stable borderline cardiomegaly  stable mediastinal and hilar contours. no alveolar consolidation  no findings of pleural effusion or pulmonary edema. no pneumothorax. no acute cardiopulmonary findings,. no pneumothorax  no pleural effusion.no pneumothorax.The patient is a 21-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and was found to have an incidental finding of a left upper lobe consolidation on his chest x-ray in the setting of fever and cough. He was started on empiric antibiotic therapy for presumed pneumonia but did not improve clinically over the next few days. The patient's condition worsened and he was admitted to our hospital where he underwent a diagnostic thoracentesis which revealed purulent pleural effusion.
2791,the heart size and pulmonary vascularity appear within normal limits. the lungs are free of focal airspace disease. no pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. no evidence of active disease.,. There is no evidence of pulmonary malignancy. The patient has a normal chest x-ray  and there are no clinical signs of acute or chronic lung disease.A follow-up CT scan at 3 months shows no abnormalities referable to the pneumothorac.A full blood count is normal. No other than an increase in platelet count. This patient is asymptomatic. She has been discharged from the hospital without further evaluation. Her parents have not worried for any medical concerns about her child's health. We feel that she is doing well. Our patients do not worry about this condition.
2809,there is a left ij tunneled for catheter tip near the caval atrial junction. the heart size is normal. mediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vascularity appear within normal limits. no edema. no focal airspace consolidation  pleural effusion or pulmonary mass seen.,. No pleural thickening is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. The chest x-ray is normal. A follow-up at 6 months shows no change in the size of the right atrium. These findings are consistent with a normal heart. We present this case report to raise awareness of cardiac masses as a cause of pericardial effusion and discuss the differential diagnosis and treatment options for pericardial effusions  which include pericardiocentesis  pericardiotomy and pericardiectomy. Our patient has an uneventful postoperative course and does not require any intervention. This patient's clinical course is similar to those described in
2902,the cardiac silhouette  upper mediastinum and pulmonary vasculature are within normal limits. there is no acute air space infiltrate  pleural effusion or pneumothorax. the visualized osseous structures are intact. no acute cardiopulmonary process.,. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. there are no abnormalities on the chest x-ray film. The patient is asymptomatic and his vital signs are normal. He is doing well at follow-up without any complications. This case demonstrates the importance of a high index of suspicion for this diagnosis in young patients presenting with fever  cough and pleuritic chest pain to the emergency department (ED). It is important to be aware of this entity as it can be treated aggressively with antibiotics and avoid delays in diagnosis and treatment may result in significant morbidity and even mortality from unnecessary invasive procedures.
459,the cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal. the lungs are well-inflated and clear. there is no focal consolidation  pneumothorax or effusion. no acute bony abnormalities are seen. no radiopaque foreign bodies are present. no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. negative examination of the chest.,. no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease is present. No abnormalities are seen on the chest x-ray. The patient is asymptomatic. There is no history of trauma or other causes of fever  chills  sweatsoreness  nausea  vomiting  headache  abdominal pain  or shortness of breath. On physical examination there are no findings of respiratory distress and no abnormal laboratory tests are noted. A follow-up at 6 months has not revealed any abnormalities. One month later the child is doing well with normal findings except for a mild right upper quadrant tenderness and an elevated liver function test.
3901,the heart is normal in size. the mediastinum is stable. postsurgical changes of esophagectomy and gastric pull-through are stable. bibasilar air space opacities have significantly improved. the lungs remain hypoinflated with blunted costophrenic. there is no pneumothorax. stable postsurgical changes of esophagectomy with improved bibasilar airspace opacities/atelectasis.,. There is no evidence of pneumothoraxsty. there are no changes in the chest x-ray image. The patient has a normal pulmonary function and no change in lung function. A follow-up at 6 months. Patient is doing well. What does it mean? How do we do it? (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) [corrected] You don't forget to repeat the study?]. We recommend repeating the report. Our findings. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease should be followed for at least 1 year  patients with acute respiratory failure should not be reevaluated at
