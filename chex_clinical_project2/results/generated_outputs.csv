The cardiac silhouette and mediastinum size are within normal limits. there is no pulmonary edema. there is no focal consolidation. there are no of a pleural effusion. there is no evidence of pneumothorax. normal chest x-.,"Findings: The results of this study showed that the mean score of knowledge, attitude, and practice of the participants in the intervention group was significantly higher than that of the control group (p < 0. 0 0 1). The mean score of knowledge, attitude, and practice of the participants in the intervention group was significantly higher than that of the control group (p < 0. 0 0 1). The mean score of knowledge, attitude, and practice of the participants in the intervention group was significantly higher than that of the control group (p < 0. 0 0 1). Conclusion: The results of this study showed that the training program had a positive effect on the knowledge, attitude, and practice of the participants. Therefore, it is recommended that the training program be used to improve the knowledge, attitude, and practice of the participants. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃"

"There are diffuse bilateral interstitial and alveolar opacities consistent with chronic obstructive lung disease and bullous emphysema. there are irregular opacities in the left lung apex, that could represent a cavitary lesion in the left lung apex. there are streaky opacities in the right upper lobe, scarring. the cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal in size and contour. there is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion. 1. bullous emphysema and interstitial fibrosis. 2. probably scarring in the left apex, although difficult to exclude a cavitary lesion. 3. opacities in the bilateral upper lobes could represent scarring, however the absence of comparison exam, recommend short interval followup radiograph or ct thorax to document resolution.","Findings: The results of this study showed that the mean score of knowledge, attitude, and practice of the participants in the intervention group was significantly higher than that of the control group (p < 0. 0 0 1).
